### Node

This template was tested with node v12.14.0 and npm v6.13.4.
If you are using nvm, this template includes a .nvmrc file. Never the less, you can do **`nvm use v12.14.0`** to use / download this version.

More details in https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm.

### CocoaPods

Do not forget to update / install cocoa Pods doing **`sudo gem install cocoapods`**.

More details in https://guides.cocoapods.org.

### React Native CLI

This template uses the new React Native Community CLI. If you have the legacy CLI installed globally, please uninstall first with **`npm uninstall -g react-native-cli`**.

See notes on this bellow.

## Notes

### React Native Legacy CLI

There seems to be quite some confusion about the legacy CLI. This template only works with the new CLI. Make sure you have uninstalled the legacy `react-native-cli` first (`npm uninstall -g react-native-cli`). If you wish, you can also install the new CLI globally (`npm i -g @react-native-community/cli` or `yarn global add @react-native-community/cli`).
